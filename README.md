Program 1 is compiled by typing "g++ prog3_1.cpp -o prog3_1 -I lua-5.3.4/src -L lua-5.3.4/src -l lua -l m -l dl" in the terminal. By typing "./prog3_1" followed by a lua file, it runs that lua file. Program 2 can be run in lua by typing "dofile('prog3_2.lua')". Typing "print(InfixToPostfix(...))" where "..." is an infix function prints out the corresponding postfix function. Program 3 is compiled by typing "g++ prog3_3.cpp -o prog3_3 -I lua-5.3.4/src -L lua-5.3.4/src -l lua -l m -l dl" in the terminal. By typing "./prog3_3 prog3_2.lua" it takes an infix function as input and it prints it as a postfix function.
